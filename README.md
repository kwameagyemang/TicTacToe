TicTacToe
The TicTacToe_Game Project

This is a simple game of tic tac toe that I created my javascript,html and css skills. My intentions was to create a game where one player plays against the computer. The game works well enough at the moment but not in a complete stage . 

I will like to eventually improve the game in a few ways:
* incorporate (Minimax AI) to satisfy the ability of a player to compete with computer, right now two players would have to play the game.
* Allow the human to choose whether to play as X or O
* Add a win counter
* Add advanced features 
*enable draw outcome 
* Add more css styling to make look more standard
